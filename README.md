this is my experiment to bridge the gap between Functional Programing languages (FP) and Go as it seems a good candidate for FP at the first glance so lets see how far this goes

## build
1. download the dependencies
    >make init
    
2. run the tests
   >make test
                    
3. generate test coverage badge
   >gopherbadger -md="README.md"
                                   
4. run test coverage and generate coverage report in html page
    >make coverage
